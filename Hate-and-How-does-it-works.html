            <p>The word "hate" is often considered as a "strong" word, but that does not mean individuals are incapable to hate others. I have seen many people show their dislike for something, solely because someone they don't like appreciates that something. After they do this, many times they even have prejudices toward specific people, beliefs, and practices, without even being aware of the nuances of the reasoning behind their hatred. In academic terms, we can refer to this state as Emotional Bias.
